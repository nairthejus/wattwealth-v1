# WattWealth Prototype — Detailed interactive

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
- mockData.json

How to use:
1. Paste these files into your GitHub repo (Add file → Create new file) replacing older ones.
2. Connect repo to Vercel (or if already connected, Vercel will auto-deploy).
3. Open the live URL. Edit `mockData.json` to tweak numbers for demos.

Notes:
- This prototype is purposely static; visually rich but not connected to live telemetry.
- To integrate real data later, replace fetch('mockData.json') with your API endpoints and map fields.
