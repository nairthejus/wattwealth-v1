# WattWealth Prototype

Interactive prototype demonstrating:
- Real-time flow visualization
- Micro-savings narrative
- 24h forecast + appliance timing tips

Built as a static prototype (index.html + JS + Chart.js) so non-developers can edit it via GitHub web UI and deploy to Vercel.

To edit: open files in the repo on GitHub, click Edit, paste new content, commit, and Vercel auto-deploys.
